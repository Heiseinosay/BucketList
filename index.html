        <p>
          One item on my bucket list is to attend every performance by a band or

          I think it is on everyone's list to travel and see the beauty of the

        <p>
          It's not only a dream, but rather a plan to keep my hands on a
          computer that makes no compromises and can provide the finest
          performance in any kind of program. Sincere to say, I'm heavily
          invested in technology, especially computers. I have a part of me that
          wants to one day play games without lag.
